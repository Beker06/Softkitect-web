            There are two ways to work with an offshore software development
            company: a dedicated team or a fixed-cost contract. Both models are
            good. Much depends upon what exactly you are looking for and what is
            your purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            The fixed-cost contract provides standard technologies and detailed
            software specifications for a fixed price, which means that you have
            all the requirements defined before starting the work.
            <br />
            <br />
            The dedicated developer contract allows select IT professionals to
            join their in-house crew for an extended period of time. Therefore,
            the total cost of the project will depend on the tasks assigned.
            There are three priority components of a successful offshore Team:
